# Open Jobs for the Rackspace Developer Experience Team

The Rackspace Developer relations group is looking for a range of skills and roles.
The Rackspace Developer Experience team is dedicated to making the cloud platform
end-to-end experience for developers, technologists, and all customers, the best
experience it can be.

Take a look at the repository for open jobs; they're in markdown, so you know
we're ok people.

We specialize in community outreach, documentation, client tools and SDKs.
We are on the front lines, engaging with our developers and helping them build
modern cloud applications, setting technical strategy for content, tools,
ecosystems and more. Our team is here to not only ship one product, but to
change the end-to-end experience from support, to content, tools and offerings.

We sponsor OSS programs and projects, contribute upstream and foster communities.
The team operates on the bleeding edge - from containers, to emerging tools,
techniques and other technologies this is a chance to make a strategic impact
not just to one team and company - but for the wider developer community!

If you believe in helping define, lead, and drive strategies focused on the
technical end user, as well as leading and growing a team of senior software
developers, then we want to talk to you!
